EnhancedCompass is a feature-rich Minecraft plugin that supercharges the vanilla compass, allowing players to point their compass to **any structure** or **any biome** in the game—villages, ancient cities, strongholds, End cities, dark forests, cherry groves, and more! Best of all, when you hold your compass, a **boss bar** displays the target name and real-time distance as you travel.

## 📦 Installation for Server Admins

### Requirements

- **Server**: Paper or Spigot 1.19+
- **Java**: Java 17 or higher
- **Dependencies**: None (Adventure API bundled with Paper)

### Installation Steps

1. **Download** the latest `EnhancedCompass.jar`
2. **Place** the JAR in your server's `plugins/` folder
3. **Start or restart** your server
4. **Configure** (optional) - Edit `plugins/EnhancedCompass/config.yml`
5. **Grant permissions** to your players (see below)

### Default Configuration

The plugin generates a `config.yml` with sensible defaults:

```yaml
# Search radius in chunks (100 = 1,600 blocks)
search-radius: 100

# Worlds where plugin is disabled
blacklisted-worlds: []

# Structure whitelist per dimension
enabled-structures:
  normal:    # Overworld
    ancient_city: true
    stronghold: true
    village_plains: true
    # ... and more
  nether:    # Nether
    fortress: true
    bastion_remnant: true
  the_end:   # End
    end_city: true

# Biome whitelist per dimension
enabled-biomes:
  normal:    # Overworld
    dark_forest: true
    cherry_grove: true
    mushroom_fields: true
    # ... and more
  nether:    # Nether
    crimson_forest: true
    warped_forest: true
  the_end:   # End
    end_highlands: true
```

### Permissions

```yaml
enhancedcompass.use       # Use compass features (default: op)
enhancedcompass.reload    # Reload configuration (default: op)
```

**Grant to all players:**
```bash
/lp group default permission set enhancedcompass.use true
```

### Reload Configuration

Make changes to `config.yml` and reload without restarting:
```
/enhancedcompass reload
```

## 🎯 How It Works

### The Boss Bar System

When you hold a compass with a target set, a boss bar appears at the top of your screen:

**Same Dimension:**
```
Ancient City - 1,432 blocks
Dark Forest - 523 blocks
```
- Aqua text = Target is in your dimension
- Yellow distance = Real-time block count

**Different Dimension:**
```
End City - Not in same dimension
```
- Red text = Warning that target is in another dimension
- Red message = You need to change dimensions first

The boss bar:
- ✅ Appears instantly when you hold the compass
- ✅ Updates every 0.5 seconds while held
- ✅ Disappears when you put the compass away
- ✅ Works in both main hand and off hand

### Structure Searches

The plugin uses Minecraft's **built-in structure location system** to find structures:

1. You run a search command
2. Plugin queries the world generator within configured radius
3. Nearest matching structure is found
4. Vanilla compass is set to point to the structure
5. Target is saved for persistence
6. Boss bar shows real-time distance

### Biome Searches

The plugin uses Minecraft's **built-in biome location system** to find biomes:

1. You run `/enhancedcompass biome <biome_name>`
2. Plugin queries the world within configured radius
3. Nearest matching biome is found
4. Vanilla compass is set to point to the biome
5. Target is saved for persistence
6. Boss bar shows real-time distance

**Search Types:**

- **Specific Structure**: `/enhancedcompass ancient_city` - Find exact structure type
- **Specific Biome**: `/enhancedcompass biome dark_forest` - Find exact biome type
- **Generic Village**: `/enhancedcompass village` - Find any village (plains, desert, snowy, etc.)
- **Generic Any**: `/enhancedcompass anything` - Find any enabled structure in current dimension

---

## 🛠️ Configuration Guide

### Search Radius

Control how far structure and biome searches extend:

```yaml
search-radius: 100  # In chunks (100 chunks = 1,600 blocks)
```

- **Lower values (25-50)**: Faster searches, but may not find targets
- **Medium values (50-100)**: Balanced performance and success rate
- **Higher values (100-200)**: Find distant targets but slower searches

### World Blacklist

Disable the plugin in specific worlds:

```yaml
blacklisted-worlds:
  - lobby
  - minigames
  - creative
```

Perfect for:
- Lobby worlds where compasses shouldn't work
- Minigame arenas with custom mechanics
- Creative worlds where finding structures would be unfair

### Structure Whitelist

Control which structures can be found per dimension:

```yaml
normal:
  ancient_city: true
  stronghold: true
  mansion: true
  # ... everything true
```

### Biome Whitelist

Control which biomes can be found per dimension:

```yaml
normal:
  dark_forest: true
  cherry_grove: true
  mushroom_fields: true
  deep_dark: true
  # ... everything true
```
