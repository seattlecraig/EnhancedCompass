Your compass target is saved automatically.

It stays set even if you:

To change target, just search for a new structure.

DISTANCE EXPLAINED

Distance is "as the crow flies" - a straight line from you to the structure.

Includes height (Y-level).

Actual walking distance may be longer due to terrain.
=====================================

CROSS-DIMENSION

If you set a target in the Overworld, then go to the Nether:

Boss bar shows:
"End City - Not in same dimension"

Return to the correct dimension to see the real distance.
